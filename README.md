## Installation
## Running a Java Source File in NetBeans

To run a Java source file (.java) in NetBeans, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open NetBeans**: Launch the NetBeans IDE on your computer.

2. **Open or Create a Project**:
   - If you already have a project, open it by selecting `File` > `Open Project` and navigating to your project directory.
   - If you don't have a project yet, you can create a new one by selecting `File` > `New Project`, then choosing `Java` category and `Java Application` project type. Follow the prompts to create the project.

3. **Add or Create the Java File**:
   - If you're opening an existing project, make sure your Java file is already added to the project.
   - If you're creating a new project, you can add a new Java file by right-clicking on the `Source Packages` folder in your project, selecting `New` > `Java Class`, then providing a name for your class and clicking `Finish`.

4. **Write or Import Code**:
   - Write your Java code in the Java file you've opened or created.
   - If you have existing Java code, you can copy and paste it into the editor or import it into your project.

5. **Run the Java File**: Once you have your Java code ready, you can run it by clicking the green `Run` button (usually represented by a play icon) in the toolbar at the top of the NetBeans window. Alternatively, you can right-click on the Java file in the project explorer and select `Run File`.

6. **View Output**: The output of your Java program will typically appear in the `Output` window at the bottom of the NetBeans IDE. Make sure to check this window for any errors or runtime messages.


## Usage
# Running a Java Application in NetBeans with MySQL Workbench

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run a Java application in NetBeans IDE while utilizing MySQL Workbench for database management.

## Prerequisites

- NetBeans IDE installed on your system.
- MySQL Workbench installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Java programming and MySQL database management.

## Steps

1. **Open NetBeans**: Launch the NetBeans IDE on your computer.

2. **Open or Create a Project**:
   - If you already have a project, open it by selecting `File` > `Open Project` and navigating to your project directory.
   - If you don't have a project yet, you can create a new one by selecting `File` > `New Project`, then choosing `Java` category and `Java Application` project type. Follow the prompts to create the project.

3. **Add or Create the Java File**:
   - If you're opening an existing project, ensure your Java file is already added to the project.
   - If you're creating a new project, add a new Java file by right-clicking on the `Source Packages` folder in your project, selecting `New` > `Java Class`, then providing a name for your class and clicking `Finish`.

4. **Write or Import Code**:
   - Write your Java code in the Java file you've opened or created.
   - If you have existing Java code, you can copy and paste it into the editor or import it into your project.

5. **Configure MySQL Database Connection**:
   - If your Java application requires a MySQL database, ensure MySQL Workbench is installed and running.
   - Use MySQL Workbench to create and configure your database schema, tables, and data as needed.
   - In your NetBeans project, configure the database connection by right-clicking on the `Libraries` folder, selecting `Add Library`, and adding the MySQL Connector/J library. Then, create a new `DataSource` in the `Services` tab and configure it to connect to your MySQL database.

6. **Run the Java Application**: 
   - Once you have your Java code ready and the database connection configured, run it by clicking the green `Run` button (usually represented by a play icon) in the toolbar at the top of the NetBeans window. Alternatively, right-click on the Java file in the project explorer and select `Run File`.

7. **View Output**: 
   - The output of your Java program will typically appear in the `Output` window at the bottom of the NetBeans IDE. Ensure to check this window for any errors or runtime messages related to your code or database connection.

========================
BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
========================

When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDE
automatically copies all of the JAR
files on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. The IDE
also adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the application
JAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).

To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "empoyee.jar" 

To distribute this project, zip up the dist folder (including the lib folder)
and distribute the ZIP file.

Notes:

* If two JAR files on the project classpath have the same name, only the first
JAR file is copied to the lib folder.
* Only JAR files are copied to the lib folder.
If the classpath contains other types of files or folders, these files (folders)
are not copied.
* If a library on the projects classpath also has a Class-Path element
specified in the manifest,the content of the Class-Path element has to be on
the projects runtime path.
* To set a main class in a standard Java project, right-click the project node
in the Projects window and choose Properties. Then click Run and enter the
class name in the Main Class field. Alternatively, you can manually type the
class name in the manifest Main-Class element.
